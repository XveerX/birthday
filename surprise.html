    <h1>💖 Just for You 💖</h1>

    <p>
	  I love you soo muchh my love. You have the been the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are the best person in my life and i could never leave you as leaving you might be the greatest fumble i could ever make in my life. I am grateful for everything you do for me and just so you know there can’t be anyone better than you in this entire multi verse. You have been such a good girlfriend this entire time. I never felt like you never loved me since we met and you never let me feel left out whenever we meet. You are the most beautiful, the prettiest, the most gorgeous, amazing women to ever exist in this realm and guess who’s the lucky person dating you me ofc. Till this day i can’t believe how i even pulled you i always had a thought of my chances before we started dating and the chances always came out to be almost none and yet i pulled you is an achievement for me. The best achievement actually. I wanted to thank you for being such a great best friend , girlfriend, friend literally any type of relation a person could have( def one of them is mommy😋😁). All the moments we spent together are so memorable to me. I remember each and every thing we do. There’s a sad part in our life right now which is we are in two different time zones and still we manage ourselves so nicely that we are loving each other even after 15-16 months of long distance. We have grown so close to each other while being far away that we now even talk about us having a crazyy good future together. We’ve even been deciding what stuff we’ll do after marriage. We even decided when to get engaged and married. We are so in love with each other that there is no chance that anyone can separate me and you from each other. We have been through crazy fights but we are still together proving we are a team and we are fighting the problems together instead of fighting with each other. Hopefully the luck never runs out and you’ll always be mine. You have been so kind caring and loving to me that it made me never even think of leaving you. You are like 1 in billion women who can be like this. One who can be caring, loving, kind, understanding, beautiful, pretty and loyal all at the same time. I am sorry for being such a jealous ass boyfriend one who gets jealous everytime even a boy talks to you and becomes a psychopath. I promise to love you for the rest of my life and to care for you no matter what and be loyal to you always. I promise to do whatever you want and become a man your dad could never reject so you don’t have to do all crying stuff to get us married. I also promise that no matter how bad you feel i’ll always be there for you. I promise to always give you after care after doing dirty stuff. I promise that no matter who comes between us i would never let us separate. I promise that i’ll marry you and keep you happy always. I promise to atleast make you travel 50 countries before we die. I love your smile soo muchh that i would do anything to see you smile. You have such great eyes that everytime i see them i everything around gets silent and i slowly start drowning in them. Those lips of yours look soo kissable all the time that i would never want to miss a chance to give you kiss. I even love your chubby cheeks they are soo squishy. I would love be by you side for the rest of my life and support you every decision. Even after having kids I promise that i’ll always take your side and never their’s because you matter to me more than them. You were my love and they are just what we made out of our love. So yeahh you are always prioritised over them to me. Even druing your pregnancy i’ll treat you so nicely that you’ll never feel that you are alone on this. We’ll do everything together and better. There’s nothing we can’t do if we are together.I promise to never let you feel alone and never forget to reassure you when something goes wrong between us. I’ll do all of this because you matter to me so much. Our starting phase was a bit shitty it went even more shit after but after all we loved each other so we came back we talked it out and now we are soo happy together. People are def jealous of what me and you have between us. They always wish they had something like us. I understand that you are a fucking super cute lady and boys will be behind you always but yeah does make super jealous because i don’t like sharing you either anyone . You’re mine and i’m not letting anyone even get 1% of you. At the end of everything I just want to say that I always loved you soo muchh, I still lovee youu soo muchhh and I alwayss will lovee youu soo muchh. I miss youu soo muchh right. I want to cuddle you soo badd and have a crazyy intense make out session asap. I crave you so badly that the moment we meet i’ll hug you soo tight that you’ll suffocate. But yeahh I love youu soo muchh my sweetheart, the love of my life and my favv person and myyy cute little babbyyy. Here’s a forehead kissie for you💋💋.
